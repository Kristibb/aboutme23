<h2>Hey, This Page is About Me!</h2>
<p>My name is <b>Kristina Kim</b>. I am from <i>Kazakstan, Almaty</i>. There is not much say about myself. I came to Canda a year ago, and i just fall in love with this country. The reason I came to Canada because my all family just moved to US. Funny, but I did not get my visa, so i decided that Canada will be my second home. First of all it closer to my family anyways, and second of all i dont like warm <q>Floridian</q> weather.</p>
